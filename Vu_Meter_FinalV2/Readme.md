This is arduino Mega only. 

Yes i know My last update was final. but i had to fix a few issues and decided to throw a few extra vu meters while i was at it. 

As usual on first power up it will auto cylce through the vu meters.
next selection will auto cycle through the patterns playlist.

Then each vu meter and pattern can be selected in turn. A total of 14 vu meters and 12 standby patterns.
