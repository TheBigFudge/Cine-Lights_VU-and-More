A ws2812b vu meter.  72 leds from a 144 led meter strip, and an arduino uno, and microphone. 

4 different vu meters patterns, and 7 standby patterns changeable via push button.

I am happy to share the code and build instructions. but please if you require further information after, please do so via email. 
I am in the process of upgrading this Vu meter from a Arduino Uno, to an  Auduino Mega due to memory constraints, so more vu patterns, and standby patterns. so if requesting code please let me know which version you require.
