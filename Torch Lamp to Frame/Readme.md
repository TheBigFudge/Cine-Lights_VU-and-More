I decided to follow up a small request to convert my previous fire lamp etc to a frame... 

it did not start to well... but worked out in the end.. for build instructions see my lamp videos, as the build is the same.. requires a lot of leds, based around the teensy 3.2 and a msgeq7 breakout board. new code listed below...
